This program allows the visualisation of the movement of a carrier within a magnetic field caused by current going through a wire, while using realisting SI units (metres, Coulombs, etc.). Does not take into an account relativistic effects. 

Note that variables current and charge can be changed in real time, while the carrier is still moving, but velocity can only be modified before launch.
